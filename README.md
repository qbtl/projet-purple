# Pong
> A simple pong game based off the 1972 ATARI pong game for the arcade.

Pong is a simple project of mine done as to increase my understanding not only of winforms but also of C# in general. Although I have previously worked in more complex projects, I feel like it is polished enough as to make it my first public repository.

## Usage example

Pong can be used as a fun little game for two players or also as project to learn from for those just starting with C# or programming in general.
